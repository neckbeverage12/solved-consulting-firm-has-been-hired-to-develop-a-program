Your consulting firm has been hired to develop a program that meets the following requirements.



Your program must provide a menu to the user. This menu should list three different products of your choice. Once the user selects one product, they should specify which state they are located. The state choices should include CT, VT, WI, CA and WA. State taxes vary for each state (7.5%, 7.8%, 6.8%, 7.2% and 6.4%, respectively). The user should then specify the desired number of cases (assume there are 12 items per case). The appropriate state tax should be added to the total cost of the product (item quantity multiplied by unit price).
